Apple Fairplay DRM decryption system

=======

Requiem allows you to decrypt iTunes content in order to watch it on non-apple devices.

=======

NOTE: This program is not meant for you to keep a permanent copy of the DRM-Free content. It has the capibility to do so, but doing so is not permitted under the DMCA. This program may only be used by those of you who, under the DMCA, are working on:

1. Identifying and Analysing the Fairplay protocol with the sole aim of achieving a means by which the produced files are interoperable with alternate software from iTunes.

2. Creating a program with which you are aiming solely to achieve interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, and that have not previously been readily available to the person engaging in the circumvention, to the extent any such acts of identification and analysis do not constitute infringement under the relevant works.

3. Examining the encryption used in the Fairplay DRM system.

=======

Any other use of this program may not be classified as legal, and is the full responsibility of the person(s) utilising the program for the unapproved practice.

=======

N.B. This program does not currently work with the latest version of iTunes.
